Tangram is a JavaScript library for rendering 2D & 3D maps live in a web browser with WebGL. It is tuned for OpenStreetMap but supports any source of GeoJSON/TopoJSON or binary vector tiles.

## Quickstart

1. Clone or download this repository:
  	- clone in a terminal window with `git clone https://github.com/tangrams/tangram.git`
  	- or download a zip directly: https://github.com/tangrams/tangram/archive/master.zip
  	- or use [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install tangram`
2. Start a webserver in the repository's directory:
  	- in a terminal window, enter: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
  	- if that doesn't work, try: `python -m http.server`
3. View the map at http://localhost:8000 (or whatever port you started the server on)

## Demos

[**highways-demo**](http://github.com/tangrams/highways-demo) - Zoom-dependent styles and contextual filtering rules

[**gui-demo**](http://github.com/tangrams/gui-demo) - Control styles in real-time with a gui

[**Tangram-sandbox**](http://github.com/tangrams/tangram-sandbox) - More complex glsl shaders


## Vector Tiles

Instead of loading traditional bitmap tiles, Tangram draws its own tiles from scratch, based on **vector tiles** that contain the source data.

Mapzen provides a free [vector tile service](http://mapzen.com/vector/) extracted from for OpenStreetMap base layer data, with worldwide coverage updated daily. There is also an [OSM.US-hosted](http://openstreetmap.us/~migurski/vector-datasource/) alternative.

Tangram currently supports GeoJSON/TopoJSON tiles as well as the [mapnik binary format](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec), both of which can be generated by the [Mapzen vector tile service](http://mapzen.com/vector/). (Here's an [example GeoJSON tile](http://vector.mapzen.com/osm/all/14/4826/6161.json).)

The library also includes a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) plugin, `Tangram.LeafletLayer`, to provide basic web map pan/zoom functionality.

## Styling

The scene file is where you specify data sources and layers, filter the data, and define and apply styles. (In our demos, this file is named scene.yaml.) The rules for doing these things are many and various, but the basics are pretty easy, and they are all meticulously documented in the Tangram Documentation https://github.com/tangrams/tangram/wiki.

The scene file is written in YAML, which is a data-serialization format like JSON, but with less punctuation. Instead, data structures are specified with whitespace, like Python. One neat side benefit is that the format is super friendly to strings, which means you can write inline JavaScript and GLSL code straight into the scene file, without needing to wrap it in quotes or concatenate anything.

## Contributions Welcome

Tangram is open-source, and we eagerly welcome feedback, feature requests, and contributions. We’re especially interested to see your maps, no matter how simple! Send screenshots, links, and any questions to tangram@mapzen.com.

### Development

If you'd like to contribute to the project or just make changes to the source code for fun, you'll need to install the development requirements and build the library:

```shell
npm install
make
```

The library will be minified in `dist/`, and `index.html` provides an example for rendering from different sources and simple Leaflet integration.

### Testing

Tests are included to ensure that the code functions as expected. To run all of the tests:

```shell
npm test
```
Every time this runs, an new browser instance is created. If you wish to
have a single browser instance and run the test suite against that
instance do the following,

```shell
make karma-start
```

And then run the tests with,

```shell
make run-tests
```

### Lint
We're using jshint to maintain code quality.

```shell
make lint
```
