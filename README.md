[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/tangrams/tangram.png?style=badge&circle-token=2529a88125530794f64ffa1783625b5357456f71)](https://circleci.com/gh/tangrams/tangram)


Tangram is a library for rendering 2D & 3D maps with WebGL, using GeoJSON/TopoJSON or binary vector tiles.

## Vector Tiles

Instead of using traditional image tiles, we render from **vector tiles** that contain the underlying source geometry for each tile's bounding box.

Mapzen provides a free [vector tile service](http://mapzen.com/vector/) that can be used with Tangram for OpenStreetMap base layer data, with worldwide coverage updated daily. There is also an [OSM.US-hosted](http://openstreetmap.us/~migurski/vector-datasource/) alternative.

Tangram currently supports GeoJSON/TopoJSON tiles as well as the [mapnik binary format](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec), both of which can be generated by the [Mapzen vector tile service](http://mapzen.com/vector/).

Here's an [example GeoJSON tile](http://vector.mapzen.com/osm/all/14/4826/6161.json).

The library also includes a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) plugin, `Tangram.LeafletLayer`, to provide basic web map pan/zoom functionality.

## Installation

```
npm install
make
```

The library will be minified in `dist/`, and `index.html` provides an example for rendering from different sources and simple Leaflet integration.

## Test

To run all of the tests.

```shell
npm test
```
Every time this runs, an new browser instance is created. If you wish to
have a single browser instance and run the test suite against that
instance do the following,

```shell
make karma-start
```

And then run the tests with,

```shell
make run-tests
```

## Lint
We use jshint to maintain code quality

```shell
make lint
```
